    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


This email is with respect to RMA {!Case.custom_rma_number__c} issued on {!Case.custom_rma_initiate_date__c}.


In accordance with the trailing email dated {!Case.custom_rma_initiate_date__c} â€“ it has been 5 days since issuing the RMA and we have still not received the required details i.e. &lt;put details required&gt;. We are thus marking the issue as resolved.
