    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


This email is with respect to RMA {!Case.custom_rma_number__c} issued on {!Case.custom_rma_initiate_date__c}.


In accordance with the trailing email dated &lt;Date of RMA Issues email&gt; â€“ it has been 30 days since issuing the RMA and we have still not received the device(s). We are thus marking the issue as resolved.


Kindly contact Invixium Tech Support as soon as possible if the issue still exists.
