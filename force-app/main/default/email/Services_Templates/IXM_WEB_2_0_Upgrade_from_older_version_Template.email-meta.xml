    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for completing the IXM WEB 2.0 webinar and we hope that you are as excited as we are about this new version!


Based on your confirmation, your existing installation of IXM WEB is an older version and as such we will require a two-step process to complete the upgrade to IXM WEB 2.0:


Step 1: Download and install IXM WEB version 1.7.0.0, click here


Step 2: Download and install IXM WEB 2.0, click here


Please do not hesitate to reach out to us via email, phone +1844 INVIXIUM (468 4948) or Skype: invixium_support should you have any additional questions.
