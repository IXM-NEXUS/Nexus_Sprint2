    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

Greetings and thank you for contacting the Invixium Technical Services team!


We are happy to address your issues as soon as possible. Till now, we have been supporting you in good faith even for out of warranty repairs at no cost, however moving forward charges will be applied as per our standard warranty policy which means that you will be invoiced for any replacements to hardware components (i.e. fingerprint sensor, LCD display, device enclosures, etc.) or damage/RMA repairs.


We have been informed through our ERP system, followed by our Finance department that the RIL account is on hold due to payment overdue. To address this with the concerned team at RIL, we are including Jayant Pathak â€“ Manager of Credit &amp; Collections, Invixium.


As a courtesy, we will continue the support via phone or email.



We appreciate your business!





Best Regards,

Invixium Technical Services Team
